The project is made of five java files:
SparseMatrix.java is the class of sparse matrix, which consists of initialize, retrieve elements, permute, scaling and so on.
Jacobi.java is the class of jacobi solver, which consists of jacobi solver, the calculate of second norm and normal norm.
SOR.java is the class of SOR solver, whose construction is similar as Jacobi.java.
Test.java is the test file, which test the solver with 5X5 matrix.
Main.java is the main function, which consists generate Sparse Matrix from local files, use the solver to solve the product
of large sparse matrix and test the solver by SOR solver.
